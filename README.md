# Korean_ASR: Korean Automatic Speech Recognition  

- It is working on Mac(Catalina 10.15.7) and Ubuntu(14.04).
- To run this program, kaldi should be installed on your computer.

### PREREQUISITE
---
1. **Install Kaldi**
	- Type below in command line.
	
		```
		$ git clone https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi.git kaldi --origin upstream
		$ cd kaldi
		$ git pull 
		```
	- Read INSTALL and follow the direction written there.

2. **Install Packages**
	- Install list: Sox, coreutils.
	-  On mac
	
		```
		$ brew install sox
		$ brew install coreutils
		```

### DIRECTION
---

1. Navigate to 'Korean_ASR' directory.
2. Open run_asr.sh with any text editor to specify user path of kaldi directory.
    - Change 'kaldi' name variable. (initial setting: kaldi=/home/kaldi)
    - Before running the main script, path.sh should be removed in version 1.2 but it should not be removed in version 1.2.1. If you removed the path.sh by mistake, then download it again.
3. Run the code by selecting krs model.
	- krs(korean readspeech) model is already provided.
	- example: 
	
		```
		$ sh run_asr.sh (language model)
		$ sh run_asr.sh krs
		```
4. You may see the recording status on the screen. Speak any sentence and stop recording by pressing Control + C.
4. Speech recognition process will be automatically initiated and a text result will be printed on the screen.
5. You can decode with your own trained model by adding it into ./models/diy directory if you prepared four files(final.mdl, final.mat, HCLG.fst, and words.txt) trained by train_tanh_fast.sh(refer to the kadli_recipe/k1 script in my github) you are able to collect those files. Once you located above files to the ./models/diy folder, type as below.

	```
	$ sh run_asr.sh diy
	```
